# Getting started
Proficiency in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is strongly recommended for practicing modern machine learning. While Python is used heavily for machine learning including deep learning, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is popular among data scientists and statisticians. A best practice is to use a separate virtual environment using [`virtualenv`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/) for each Python project except when deploying to a container. After mastering Python, here are some basic starter resources for applied machine learning:

## Preparation
Before getting started with a curriculum, it helps to learn how to learn:
* [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
* [Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift)

## Orientation
* [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)

## Education
It is beneficial to gain demonstrable education in machine learning and to develop a corresponding portfolio of projects. To this end, the following should be of strong interest:
* [Cousera Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)
* [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Refer to the [full list](https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science/machine-learning?languages=en) of Coursera machine learning specializations.

## Videos
* [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/)
* [DeepLearning.TV YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjJh1vlSEYgvZ3ze_4pxKHNh1g5PId36-) -- 17 ~5-min vids, good starter -- introduces the main ideas at a non-technical level.
* [Andrew Ng's ML Coursera course](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A89DCFA6ADACE599) -- best beginner course.
* [Hinton's Coursera course: Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) (Youtube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoRl3Ht4JOcdU872GhiYWf6jwrk_SNhz9)) -- gets pretty advanced, and much of the later material is fast becoming obsolete (RBM, WakeSleep, DBM, DBN). Nevertheless, Hinton is the single biggest contributor to modern ML, and it's worth persevering with.

## Books
<!--Free PDF books only-->
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (unofficial python notebooks: [1](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python), [2](https://github.com/emredjan/ISL-python))
* [Nielsen -- Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) -- online book, recommended for beginners.

## Papers
These are introductory papers, some of which are written for a specific technical audience, e.g. physicists, engineers, etc.; they are nevetheless generally applicable.
