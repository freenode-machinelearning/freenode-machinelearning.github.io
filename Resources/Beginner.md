## Preparation
Proficiency in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is strongly recommended for practicing modern machine learning. While Python is used heavily for machine learning including deep learning, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is popular among data scientists and statisticians. For Python, a best practice is to use a separate virtual environment using [`virtualenv`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/) or [`conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/) for each project. After mastering Python, here are some basic starter resources for applied machine learning:

Although not a technical topic, daily exercise, excellent nutrition and sufficient sleep are a must; they greatly assist with learning. Before getting started with a curriculum, it is essential to learn how to learn:
* [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
* [Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift)

## Orientation
* [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)
* [fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning For Coders](http://course.fast.ai/)

## Education
It is beneficial to gain demonstrable education in machine learning and to develop a corresponding portfolio of projects. To this end, the following Coursera specializations should be of strong interest:

Prerequisites:
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)

Main:
* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)
* [Data Mining](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-mining)
* [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
* [Machine Learning with TensorFlow on GCP](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

Advanced:
* [Advanced Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml)
* [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models)

Data science:
* [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
* [Introduction to Applied Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-applied-data-science)
* [Applied Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
* [Executive Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/executive-data-science)
* [Data Science at Scale](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science)

Refer to the [full list](https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science/machine-learning?languages=en) of Coursera machine learning specializations and courses.

## Vocation
Getting trained in cloud offerings is of interest with regard to corporate employment.
* [AWS Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learning-paths/machine-learning/)

## Miscellaneous
### Videos
* [DeepLearning.TV YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjJh1vlSEYgvZ3ze_4pxKHNh1g5PId36-) -- 17 ~5-min vids, good starter -- introduces the main ideas at a non-technical level.
<!-- These are obsoleted by Coursera specializations:
* [Andrew Ng's ML Coursera course](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A89DCFA6ADACE599) -- best beginner course.
* [Hinton's Coursera course: Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) (Youtube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoRl3Ht4JOcdU872GhiYWf6jwrk_SNhz9)) -- gets pretty advanced, and much of the later material is fast becoming obsolete (RBM, WakeSleep, DBM, DBN). Nevertheless, Hinton is the single biggest contributor to modern ML, and it's worth persevering with.

### Books
<!--Free PDF books only-->
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning (2013)](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (unofficial python notebooks: [1](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python), [2](https://github.com/emredjan/ISL-python))
* [Nielsen -- Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) -- online book, recommended for beginners.

<!-- Not maintained
### Papers
Refer to the list of scholarly [introductory papers](ArticlesIntroductory.md) to machine learning.
